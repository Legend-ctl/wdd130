        <h1>Moses John | WDD 130</h1>
        <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hello My name is Moses">
        <p>Hello, my name is Moses John, and I am from Nigeria. I have a strong passion for technology, and I enjoy spending my time coding and exploring new ways to improve my skills as a programmer. Over the years, I have developed a deep interest in how software works and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I believe that technology is one of the most powerful tools for innovation, and I am always eager to learn how to use it more effectively.

When I am not coding, I love playing games, not only because they help me relax but also because they challenge my creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Games often inspire me to think outside the box, and many times I find myself trying to understand the logic behind them or imagining how I would design my own. This combination of fun and mental stimulation makes gaming one of my favorite hobbies.

I am also a naturally curious person, and I enjoy learning new things in every area of life. Whether it is related to technology, personal growth, history, or general knowledge, I always try to broaden my perspective. I believe that knowledge is endless, and the more I learn, the more opportunities I create for myself in the future.

Another important part of who I am is my work ethic. I consider myself hardworking, focused, and disciplined. When I set a goal for myself, I dedicate time and effort to achieve it no matter the challenges I face. I am also open-minded, which helps me to adapt to different situations, work well with others, and learn from people with different ideas and experiences.

Beyond academics and technology, I am also passionate about personal development. I like setting challenges for myself, such as improving my communication skills, building discipline, or pushing myself to stay consistent in my goals. These qualities, I believe, are just as important as technical knowledge because they shape the kind of person I am becoming.</p>
